### What I learned
I finally used variables in CSS.

    --soft-blue: hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
    --cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    --main-BG: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
    --card-BG: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    --line: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I have to learn how to use the mobile first, in order to make websites with responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [CSS :hover Selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally the property hover. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
